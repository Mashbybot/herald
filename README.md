## Why Herald?

**Pattern observed:** When official tools are absent, Hunters build their own.

Herald exists because the Hunter community couldn't wait. We needed character tracking. We needed H5E-specific dice mechanics. We needed something that understood Edge, Desperation, and Conviction decay.

So we built it.

**Key design principles:**
- ✅ **H5E mechanical accuracy** - Edge, Desperation, and messy crits work correctly
- ✅ **Zero setup required** - Add bot, create character, start rolling
- ✅ **Privacy-focused** - Local SQLite database, no external data collection
- ✅ **Open source** - Community-driven development
- ✅ **Free forever** - No premium tiers, no paywalls, no subscriptions

Herald is maintained by active H5E players who use it in their own campaigns. We hunt with you.
